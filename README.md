# OOP

This Java web app is a simple CRUD web application with admin login functionality, developed using Eclipse IDE and OOP concepts. It utilizes servlets to handle requests and responses on the backend server, while the frontend is built using JSP web pages. When a request is made from the frontend, it is directed to the relevant servlet in the backend. The servlets use service classes (Java files in the services package) to handle the requests, acting as a bridge between the database and the backend. Service files contain the database queries relevant to their operations.

## Admin Functionality:

- Login, logout, and register.
- Add, view, edit, and delete employees.
- View and delete all registered users.
